Just for personal reference.
The proposed experiment flow is to mask the incoming images and perform inpainting operation on the same.
Areas to focus on is to verify if the neural network used for performing image inpainting works well on adversarial images, this is a little fuzzy because to use
neighboring pixel information for image completion, the effect of adversarial noise is a little unclear.
